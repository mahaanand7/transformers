Previous studies have identified disease subtypes using data-driven approaches, but replication across cohorts has not always been possible, and translation of these subtypes into clinical practice has not yet been achieved. Models developed to date have several key limitations including use of cross-sectional data to define the subtypes, model assumptions that each subtype follows a fixed progression, and not accounting for both positive and negative effects of symptomatic therapies for Parkinson’s disease.
